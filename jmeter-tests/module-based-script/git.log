Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'release-2.1.0'
from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

ke sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
